        </div>
        <p>Did you know that monsters can also feel anxious and go through times where they need help? That monsters actually have tiny monsters inside of them, that crawl out and TERRORIZE them?! Well, they do, and that’s why they go to school…to learn how to keep their monster inside their monster-trap goo.
Spook a tour at the MonstersHealth Academy, where lunch time is monster time!

Episodic treatment - Lunches & Dragons
A show about a group of middle school magical monsters who on their lunch, create their own stories to work through their problems together.. and play clawgrown pretend.
It combines clinical play therapy, table top role playing, and festering fears of what lurks within us, to tell stories about teamwork, compromise, friendship and spirit. Even with fun and games, the stakes are high - especially if our main protagnonist EXPLOTARI doesn't eat on time; there is a fine line between her meerely playing with her firespells... and becoming a literal firing flame of hunger...so watch out, and don't forget your lunch!

Format: 11 minutes episodes, opening with a 1m live action sequence to frame the problem followed by 1.5 minutes animated magic adventure, and 30 second live action resolution.</p>

emotions and ‘expressions’) </div>
        </div>
        <p> In a world where animate food is as common as a household pet, Radish, a mute but bold radish will do anything to show the world that he’s more than his hard exterior, that he is as ravishing as a strawberry. Trying to find their identity is tough but with the help of a bounciful raspberry friend, Radish realizes that digging deep and shining bright is possible.
Narrated by the vain and heedless Radish himself, Radberry follows Radish, as he tries to fit into the sweet and spectacular world around him and instead discovers what it really means to love your roots.</p>

        <h2>Suzie the raindrop</h2>
        <div class="info">
          <div class="tag">32x11'</div>
          <div class="tag"> 6-12ys / parent co-watch </div>
          <div class="tag"> Animated with overlay of raindrop/nature stock footage </div>
        </div>
        <p> “Suzie!  Oh Suzie.”

That’s what everyone has to say about her, with equal measure of glee and distress – Suzie is always eager and trying new things, it just…doesn’t always work out.  How much trouble can a little raindrop cause, you ask?

Oh, that’s right: Suzie is a literal little raindrop, set on exploring the world, making new friends, and learning all that she can.

Suzie is an inquisitive, brash, bubbling little girl, but she can be pretty shy, too.  The other raindrops, creatures, and people she meets don’t take her seriously at first, so she has to work up her nerve to be swallowed by a whale, fall on a volcano, or burst down a dam.  But Suzie has a strong sense of herself and doesn’t get lost in the rush.

And as a little drop of water, she can go anywhere.  Suzie is a bit plumper than the average raindrop, but what’s really big are her heart and smile.

Catchphrase: “Okay Suzie, keep it together.  You can do this!”

The Salty Boys
“Boys!”

Our troublemaking antagonists (and sometimes friends), the Salty Boys are three brothers: Steamy, Swirly, and Flow.  They are constantly causing chaos, and rarely do they learn that this NOT a good idea.  Each of the brothers has white freckles.

Swirly is the brains of the operation, but his plans are too complicated and always go down the drain.  He twists his body to check for eavesdroppers when making a plan.

Steamy is a charmer and he does the talking when the boys get into trouble...as long as he doesn’t lose his temper first.  Steamy is tall and bubbles up when he gets excited.

Flow’s gotta go!  He doesn’t really care about what the plan is or who came up with it, he just wants to have fun (and wink at the camera).  Flow is short and wide, except for when he is something else, like a triangle, or a guitar.

Catchphrase: “heheheh”
The World


Water, water everywhere and not a drop to talk to; there is lots of water, but there are only a few Raindrops.  Well, actually, there are lots of them, too - millions! - but if you put them all in a pool you wouldn’t even have enough for a good race.  It takes a long time to make a Raindrop, a real raindrop, and the grownups aren’t too clear on how - something about comets and lightning.  Anyway, most water is just water.

But that doesn’t mean it does nothing!

Water is a mighty force, and when a Raindrop focuses and believes in themselves, they can almost move oceans.  They can definitely take over a whole puddle to talk to (or splash) someone!  Or throw waves around.  And if enough Raindrops work together, they can cook up a storm….as long as they don’t get carried away, first.

Evaporation can be scary, but it’s survivable as long as the Raindrop keeps it together and reaffirms their sense of self during the journey.  What’s really scary to a Raindrop is pollution, because passing through a bunch of YUCK! can make a Raindrop really sick!  

Then they would have to spend a lot of time resting and recovering and laying in a cloud, which is comfy, but not all that exciting - even being stuck in a camel for a month is still an adventure!  But staying home sick….well, no Raindrop ever wants to do that because it’s just no fun.
