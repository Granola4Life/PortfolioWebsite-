        </div>
        <p>Did you know that monsters can also feel anxious and go through times where they need help? That monsters actually have tiny monsters inside of them, that crawl out and TERRORIZE them?! Well, they do, and that’s why they go to school…to learn how to keep their monster inside their monster-trap goo.
Spook a tour at the MonstersHealth Academy, where lunch time is monster time!

Episodic treatment - Lunches & Dragons
A show about a group of middle school magical monsters who on their lunch, create their own stories to work through their problems together.. and play clawgrown pretend.
It combines clinical play therapy, table top role playing, and festering fears of what lurks within us, to tell stories about teamwork, compromise, friendship and spirit. Even with fun and games, the stakes are high - especially if our main protagnonist EXPLOTARI doesn't eat on time; there is a fine line between her meerely playing with her firespells... and becoming a literal firing flame of hunger...so watch out, and don't forget your lunch!

Format: 11 minutes episodes, opening with a 1m live action sequence to frame the problem followed by 1.5 minutes animated magic adventure, and 30 second live action resolution.</p>

        </div>
        <p> In a world where animate food is as common as a household pet, Radish, a mute but bold radish will do anything to show the world that he’s more than his hard exterior, that he is as ravishing as a strawberry. Trying to find their identity is tough but with the help of a bounciful raspberry friend, Radish realizes that digging deep and shining bright is possible.
Narrated by the vain and heedless Radish himself, Radberry follows Radish, as he tries to fit into the sweet and spectacular world around him and instead discovers what it really means to love your roots.</p>

        <h2>Suzie the raindrop</h2>

          <div class="tag"> 6-12ys / parent co-watch </div>

        </div>
        <p> “Suzie!  Oh Suzie.”

That’s what everyone has to say about her, with equal measure of glee and distress – Suzie is always eager and trying new things, it just…doesn’t always work out.  How much trouble can a little raindrop cause, you ask?

Oh, that’s right: Suzie is a literal little raindrop, set on exploring the world, making new friends, and learning all that she can.

Suzie is an inquisitive, brash, bubbling little girl, but she can be pretty shy, too.  The other raindrops, creatures, and people she meets don’t take her seriously at first, so she has to work up her nerve to be swallowed by a whale, fall on a volcano, or burst down a dam.  But Suzie has a strong sense of herself and doesn’t get lost in the rush.

And as a little drop of water, she can go anywhere.  Suzie is a bit plumper than the average raindrop, but what’s really big are her heart and smile.

Catchphrase: “Okay Suzie, keep it together.  You can do this!”

The Salty Boys
“Boys!”

Our troublemaking antagonists (and sometimes friends), the Salty Boys are three brothers: Steamy, Swirly, and Flow.  They are constantly causing chaos, and rarely do they learn that this NOT a good idea.  Each of the brothers has white freckles.

Swirly is the brains of the operation, but his plans are too complicated and always go down the drain.  He twists his body to check for eavesdroppers when making a plan.

Steamy is a charmer and he does the talking when the boys get into trouble...as long as he doesn’t lose his temper first.  Steamy is tall and bubbles up when he gets excited.

Flow’s gotta go!  He doesn’t really care about what the plan is or who came up with it, he just wants to have fun (and wink at the camera).  Flow is short and wide, except for when he is something else, like a triangle, or a guitar.

Catchphrase: “heheheh”
The World


Water, water everywhere and not a drop to talk to; there is lots of water, but there are only a few Raindrops.  Well, actually, there are lots of them, too - millions! - but if you put them all in a pool you wouldn’t even have enough for a good race.  It takes a long time to make a Raindrop, a real raindrop, and the grownups aren’t too clear on how - something about comets and lightning.  Anyway, most water is just water.

But that doesn’t mean it does nothing!

Water is a mighty force, and when a Raindrop focuses and believes in themselves, they can almost move oceans.  They can definitely take over a whole puddle to talk to (or splash) someone!  Or throw waves around.  And if enough Raindrops work together, they can cook up a storm….as long as they don’t get carried away, first.

Evaporation can be scary, but it’s survivable as long as the Raindrop keeps it together and reaffirms their sense of self during the journey.  What’s really scary to a Raindrop is pollution, because passing through a bunch of YUCK! can make a Raindrop really sick!  

Then they would have to spend a lot of time resting and recovering and laying in a cloud, which is comfy, but not all that exciting - even being stuck in a camel for a month is still an adventure!  But staying home sick….well, no Raindrop ever wants to do that because it’s just no fun.

Pilot: A Weeeeeeeeee Jump 

Beats - 11 minutes:
	•	Intro - 30-60 seconds 
	•	Classroom - 3.5 minutes 
	◦	Pan in Narration - 20 seconds 
	◦	“What’s your dream?” sequence/teasing - 1 minute 
	▪	Foreshadowing of Swirly’s plans? 
	◦	Madame DePluie gives lesson - 1 minute 
	◦	“Any questions class? / C’est impossible!” - 1 minute 
	◦	Focus on Raindrop/ fade out Narration - 15 seconds 
	•	Suzie at home - 1 minute 
	◦	Fade in shot of her crying/making herself smaller 
	◦	Papa Raindrop enters and asks what’s wrong 
	◦	Reassures - “You can do anything!  Just keep yourself together, even if you're scared!” speech / lifting Suzie’s tears back in 
	◦	Fade out 
	•	The Jump - 1 Minute 
	◦	Cut in midway through the Salty Boys discussing a nefarious plot 
	▪	“What are you guys talking about?”   “Nothin!/Nothin!/A scheme!” *glare* 
	◦	Madame DePluie speech and first to jump 
	▪	Weeeeee 
	▪	Weeeeee 
	▪	Suzie steps up/okay, keep it together/hehehe 
	▪	Nooooo! 
	•	The Fall - 3 minutes, compressed to 1 
	◦	Tumbling.  A timer appears ticking down from 3:00 very quickly.  It slows to normal speed when they talk, then back up.  Intense music plays. 
	◦	“Why did you do that?!”  “I thought it would be fun.”  “But I’m going to miss the river!”  “There’s another one!  Look!!  We have three minutes!!!”   “I’m not talking to you.” 
	◦	More tumbling, with different angle shots quickly cutting back and forth and the ground getting closer and closer. 
	◦	As they approach terminal velocity, they start to break apart.  Suzie has her “keep it together” mantra and is okay, but notices Flow is too big, too, and is disintegrating.  She helps him. 
	◦	It works.  They reach out to high five, and just as they are about to, they hit a Dragonfly. 
	•	Mr Dragonfly - 3 Minutes 
	◦	He is not very happy and refuses to talk to the raindrops, but they are all stuck on the ground together. 
	◦	Suzie begins counting his eyes’ Ommatidia; there is a time lapse and she wears him down. 
	◦	“Why did you have to hit me, you little, say, what are you, anyway?”  “I’m Suzie Raindrop”  “Shoot Lil Suzie, I asked what you are.”  “Oh” (1 minute) 
	◦	Suzie repeats the lesson from earlier, explaining where rain clouds come from. (1 minute) 
	◦	“Really now?  That just might help me meet the right girlfriend, lots of other boy Dragonflies that don’t know when it rains…”  “I could be your girlfriend”  “Can you fly?”  “No, that’s impossible.”  “I’d show you if I could, might help get you back on time”  “I wish you were dry” 
	◦	A beam of light shines down on them, drying the wings!  It’s the Sun/Narrator.  
	◦	They climb on Mr. Dragonfly, with the sun loudly singing what they’re doing as they fly across the city and Mr. Dragonfly tries to explain flight; “Hey can you keep it down?!  I’m trying to teach these kids!” 
	◦	The sun begins to set and gets quieter,  

Intro, 1 Minute: There is a tub filling with water on a slowly zooming shot and a distant roar, growing louder, until…..
SMASH CUT to a glacier shelf crashing into the sea, THUNDER, LIGHTNING!  A ship is rocked in a stormy sea, it crashes into a huge wave and throws up spray, we zoom to see…
Suzie! In mid-air, frozen, she looks at the camera, giggles, then plunges down, landing in a toilet bowl with her raindrop friends and classmates, they laugh to a flushing sound as they swirl down the drain and the camera zooms to the center/black, then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 staggered raindrops hurtle horizontally through separate pipes from left to right across the screen, when each reaches the right side of the screen, a new sequence starts from the left….
Water with an animated raindrop shooting out of an eyewash station and into an eyeball!
Down a waterslide!
Inside a hydraulic motor!
Out of a bubbling forest spring!
Spinning and getting dizzy in a lab centrifuge!
Then, the screen rotates 90 degrees to the left, and all of the raindrops are dumped...
Into a rushing, roaring river and then laughing over a waterfall, all of the raindrops faaaaalllll…..
Into a cloud and then into their seats at school around Madame DePluie, who says “....and today we will learn about….”
