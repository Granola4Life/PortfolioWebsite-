        <p> Brave and Berserk are rez mutts adopted at birth by an Anishinabe and British-Canadian LGBTQ2S+ couple. We experience life through the eyes of the
          puppies going back and forth between the bush and the city. Brave is a foil for the Anishinabe experience and Berserk for the British-Canadian, both being
          terms for warriors in their respective cultures. The problems of their owners may be out of their control, but how they react differently to each experience helps shape a better understanding and bond between the two. Based on a true story from the lives of Dude and Chester.
