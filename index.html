        <p>Did you know that monsters can also feel anxious and go through times where they need help?
           That monsters actually have tiny monsters inside of them, that crawl out and TERRORIZE them?! 
           Well, they do, and that’s why they go to school…to learn how to keep their monster inside their monster-trap goo.
           Spook a tour at the MonstersHealth Academy, where lunch time is monster time!
           Episodic treatment - Lunches & Dragons
           A show about a group of middle school magical monsters who on their lunch, create their own stories to work through their problems together.. and play clawgrown pretend.
           It combines clinical play therapy, table top role playing, and festering fears of what lurks within us, to tell stories about teamwork, compromise, friendship and spirit. Even with fun and games, the stakes are high - especially if our main protagnonist EXPLOTARI doesn't eat on time; there is a fine line between her meerely playing with her firespells... and becoming a literal firing flame of hunger...so watch out, and don't forget your lunch!

        </div>
        <p>In a world where humans had food as pets, Radish, a quiet but bold...um.... radish ....will do anything to show the world that he’s more than his hard exterior, that he is as ravishing as a strawberry. Trying to find their identity is tough but with the help of a bounciful raspberry friend, Radish realizes that digging deep and shining bright is possible.
           Narrated by the vain and heedless Radish himself, Radberry follows Radish, as he tries to fit into the sweet and spectacular world around him and instead discovers what it really means to love your roots.</p>

        </div>
        <p> Brave and Berserk are rez mutts adopted at birth by an Anishinabe and British-Canadian LGBTQ2S+ couple. We experience life through the eyes of the
          puppies going back and forth between the bush and the city. Brave is a foil for the Anishinabe experience and Berserk for the British-Canadian, both being
          terms for warriors in their respective cultures. The problems of their owners may be out of their control, but how they react differently to each experience helps shape a better understanding and bond between the two. Based on a true story from the lives of Dude and Chester.

          <div class="tag">32x11'</div>
          <div class="tag"> 6-12ys / parent co-watch </div>
          <div class="tag">Animated with overlay of raindrop/nature stock footage</div>
        </div>
        <p> “Suzie!  Oh Suzie.” That’s what everyone has to say about her, with equal measure of glee and distress – Suzie is always eager and trying new things, it just…doesn’t always work out.  How much trouble can a little raindrop cause, you ask?
             Oh, that’s right: Suzie is a literal little raindrop, set on exploring the world, making new friends, and learning all that she can. 
             And as a little drop of water, she can go anywhere.  Suzie is a bit plumper than the average raindrop, but what’s really big are her heart and smile.
             Suzie is an inquisitive, brash, bubbling little girl, but she can be pretty shy, too.  The other raindrops, creatures, and people she meets don’t take her seriously at first, so she has to work up her nerve to be swallowed by a whale, fall on a volcano, or burst down a dam.  But Suzie has a strong sense of herself and doesn’t get lost in the rush.
