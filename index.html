        <h9>About Elizabeth Ladouceur</h9>
        <p> Having a mixed identity in all the senses, Canadian-Mexican content creator Elizabeth Ladouceur dreamt of a cross platform game & storyworld where one could delve into the fears and monsters within.

            urMonster content has things for all age groups, from pre-school to Tweens --- each piece connecting as you play/watch on. Mixing storytelling with kid driven narratives with a focus on family connections and mental health, Elizabeth uses her clinical research experience and TV experience to bring stories from a blend of apps, stop animation, animation, VFX, and live action.
