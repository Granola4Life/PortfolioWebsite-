          <div class="tag">Stop motion intro that dives into an animated monster goop world of urMonster's Academy --- aka Monster school where monsters battle out the monsters within themselves</div>
        </div>
        <p>Did you know that monsters can also feel anxious and go through times where they need help? That monsters actually have tiny monsters inside of them, that crawl out and TERRORIZE them?! Well, they do, and that’s why they go to school…to learn how to keep their monster inside their monster-trap goo.
Spook a tour at the MonstersHealth Academy, where lunch time is monster time!

Episodic treatment - Lunches & Dragons
A show about a group of middle school magical monsters who on their lunch, create their own stories to work through their problems together.. and play clawgrown pretend.
It combines clinical play therapy, table top role playing, and festering fears of what lurks within us, to tell stories about teamwork, compromise, friendship and spirit. Even with fun and games, the stakes are high - especially if our main protagnonist EXPLOTARI doesn't eat on time; there is a fine line between her meerely playing with her firespells... and becoming a literal firing flame of hunger...so watch out, and don't forget your lunch!

Format: 11 minutes episodes, opening with a 1m live action sequence to frame the problem followed by 1.5 minutes animated magic adventure, and 30 second live action resolution.</p>

          <div class="tag">live action stop-motion series with animated elements overlayed (in their
emotions and ‘expressions’) </div>
        </div>
        <p> In a world where animate food is as common as a household pet, Radish, a mute but bold radish will do anything to show the world that he’s more than his hard exterior, that he is as ravishing as a strawberry. Trying to find their identity is tough but with the help of a bounciful raspberry friend, Radish realizes that digging deep and shining bright is possible.
Narrated by the vain and heedless Radish himself, Radberry follows Radish, as he tries to fit into the sweet and spectacular world around him and instead discovers what it really means to love your roots.</p>
